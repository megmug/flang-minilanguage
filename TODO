TODO before presentation:
- nicer outputs, more pretty printing, especially typifier
- presentation slides

stretch goal:
for 1.1.0.0:
- investigate feasibility of eliminating precompiled heap from the code generator using AddDef command
- investigate feasibility of eliminating hardcoded operator-code from code generator
- investigate feasibility of rewriting again after typification to reduce instruction set even more
for 1.2.0.0:
- investigate higher order functions: is this currently possible? why/why not? how easy to implement?
