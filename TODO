for 1.0.0.0:
- implement better error handling in Code Generator (see test cases)
- refactor code generation as two stages: first expression re-writing (e.g. eliminating let bindings) to generate simpler expressions that then get generated
- implement type system
stretch goal:
for 1.1.0.0:
- investigate feasibility of eliminating precompiled heap from the code generator using AddDef command
- investigate feasibility of eliminating hardcoded operator-code from code generator
for 1.2.0.0:
- investigate higher order functions: is this currently possible? why/why not? how easy to implement?
