TODO before presentation (1.2.0.0):
- nicer outputs, more pretty printing, especially typifier
- make addition of inbuilt functions dependent on presence of these operators in the program
- create generalLib for general definitions like prettyPrint class
- refactor topological sorting for let definitions
stretch goal:
for 1.2.0.0:
- make typifier check for arrow-type-return-value in function (which machine doesn't support) - may be diffucult to implement, may be more simple to implement more powerful machine that supports whnf return arguments
- investigate feasibility of eliminating precompiled heap from the code generator using AddDef command
- investigate feasibility of eliminating hardcoded operator-code from code generator
- investigate feasibility of rewriting again after typification to reduce instruction set even more
for 1.3.0.0:
- investigate higher order functions: currently not possible with this abstract machine. what would be required to enable this?
