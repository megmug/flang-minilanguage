TODO before presentation:
- nicer outputs, more pretty printing, especially typifier
- provide simple README
- more tests for typifier specifically
- make typifier check for arrow-type-return-value in function (which machine doesn't support)
stretch goal:
for 1.1.0.0:
- investigate feasibility of eliminating precompiled heap from the code generator using AddDef command
- investigate feasibility of eliminating hardcoded operator-code from code generator
- investigate feasibility of rewriting again after typification to reduce instruction set even more
for 1.2.0.0:
- investigate higher order functions: currently not possible with this abstract machine. what would be required to enable this?
