for 0.1.0.0:
- fix if-then-else conditions (currently implemented wrongly?)
- fix let expression bindings (currently seems to be shadowed by function variables? bug in code generator?)
for 0.2.0.0:
- investigate feasibility of eliminating precompiled heap from the code generator using AddDef command
- investigate feasibility of eliminating hardcoded operator-code from code generator
for 0.3.0.0:
- implement type system
- implement better error handling in Code Generator
stretch goal:
- investigate higher order functions: is this currently possible? why/why not? how easy to implement?
