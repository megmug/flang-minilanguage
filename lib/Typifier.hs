{- Rough outline for how we want to typify a program:
 - we start by grouping the definitions into mutually recursive sets of functions
 - we sort the set of these sets topologically
 - we typify these mutually recursive sets in topological order
 - to kickstart the typification process of such a set, we calculate type assumptions based on the function signatures
 - the type assumptions also include an assumption for every predefined operator - for example: '*' :: Integer -> Integer -> Integer
 - we iteratively typify again and again, obtaining new type assumptions every time, until the assumptions stabilize (this should be roughly the iterative typification in KFPTS)
 - once we obtain a (stable) type for the main function, we stop
 - if the obtained main type is a bool or integer, typification is successful and we return that type
 - if not, typification fails
 - also, typification can fail at any point if any inconsistent type is encountered (e.g. * instantiated with a bool
